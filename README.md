# ðŸš€ Agentic Bot & ML Model Projects

This repository contains two independent projects that showcase applied AI development:

### ðŸ¤– Agentic Bot

* A conversational, task-oriented **agentic bot** built to automate workflows and respond intelligently to user queries.
* Designed with modular architecture for easy integration into applications or platforms.
* Supports dynamic decision-making and context-aware interactions.

### ðŸ“Š Machine Learning Model

* A custom-built **ML model** trained for predictive analysis.
* Implements data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and visualization.
* Focused on achieving accuracy, scalability, and interpretability.

### ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

* IBM cloud and IBM Watsonx Auto ai, IBM Waisonx.ai.

### ðŸŒŸ Highlights

* Combines **agentic AI capabilities** with **ML-driven intelligence**.
* Structured for clarity, so each project can be explored independently.
* Open-source and extendable for research, learning, or real-world applications.
